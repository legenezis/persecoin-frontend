# Cadena PROJECT 2 - PerseCoin Front End

This is the front end for the PerseCoin smart contract.

Appended below is the smart contract README:

This contract creates PerseCoin, a token that follows the ERC-20 standard.

It is a simple smart contract that inherits functionality from OpenZeppelin. Specifically, PerseCoin is burnable and mintable.

Do take a look!
